# {meta.title}

This is a short description of what has been used in the project, continuasly updated with links to where i've purchased things.

## {meta.headers[0]}

- 4 rasberry pies 8gb
- 4x sanddisk 32gb usb harddrive sticks.
- Seagate expansion HDD 4TB
- 4 usb cables 0.5 meter ( could probably go for 0.25M or 0.125M)
- 4 ethernet cables (bought a role cause i have tools at home)
- anker usb loader 8 slot.
- switch Name here.
- rasberry pi acrylic case 4 pieces. includes fans + heatsinks

## {meta.headers[1]}

The total cost came in around 500 dollars, quite a lot however there are modifications that can be made to reduce the price!\
For example one does not need ethernet connecton since raspberry pi comes with bluetooth and can easily be setup.
This would also remove the need for a switch.

Anothor cutback is to go for the 4gb rasberry pies instead. Which can be found here

## {meta.headers[2]}

Everything can be found on amazon or your local hardware store!
If you want to help me out use the links above in the hardware section ğŸ¤“
