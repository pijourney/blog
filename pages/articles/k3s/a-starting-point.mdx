The idea was to create a small cluster of raspberry pies that serves as a easy hosting ground for various ides.
Aswell as to learn more about how to create and maintain a bare metal cluster thus rasberry pies make an execellent starting point.

## Design

<ExportedImage
  src={meta.imgUrl}
  alt={meta.imgAlt}
  layout="responsive"
  width="100%"
  height="50%"
/>

The master node will be on 192.168.0.1 with hits nodes being on the addresses:

- 192.168.0.2
- 192.168.0.3
- 192.168.0.4

On 192.168.0.5 a 4rth rasberry pi will be located which hosts docker repository along other miscellaneous utilities, read more here.
