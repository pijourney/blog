So after understanding what we are going to archive lets get started by setting up the rasberry pies.
A quick summary of what has ty be done is the following:

- Installing an operating system on each of the sub sticks.
- Configuring and installing k3s on each rasberry pi.
- Setup the master
- Setup each node.

Start of by installing [Rasberry Pi Manager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on your desktop or laptop.
For each rasberry pi's usb stick repeat the following process.
Start of by insert the usb stick into preferably a usb 3 port.
Hit the "CHOOSE OS" button and choose the os you want to use, i choose "Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite" which is a Debian based OS optimized for rasberry pi.
The light version is a minimalist version which does not come with a desktop, perfect for us since we will be working through ssh anwyay.
The last thing we want to do is to hit the cugwheel and setup SSH with username and password, a hostname and locales.
- Check set hostname and write a hostname for ur pi.
- Check Enable SSH and use the username and password.
- Check Set username and password and type in a username and a password.
- Check Set locale settings and enter the locale ur currently in.
- Lastly scroll to the top and change from Image custimization options from: "for this session only" to "to allways use".

Then hit "CHOOSE STORAGE" and check the usb.
Lastly hit write, give it a few minutes and then repeat the above process for each other raspberry pies usb, however change hostname.

## {meta.headers[1]}
Insert the newly formated usb stick and hook up the raspberry pi with a internet and a power cable.
Then open up a command prompt on your desktop/laptop and type ssh username@hostname enter the password in the prompt that pops up once you hit enter.
### Configurations
1. Enable container features
```
sudo vi /boot/cmd line.txt

```
Then enter the following at the end of the file: cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory

2. Switch Debian firewall to legacy

```
sudo update-alternatives — set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
sudo update-alternatives — set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
```
If you get an error you might have to download the legacy by running the following "sudo apt-get install -y iptables arptables ebtables"

## {meta.headers[2]}

 Choose one rasberry pi to be the master node and run the following on it.
 Setting up the enviromental variables.
 ```
 export K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE=”644"
 ```
 Installing k3s.
```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```
Grab the token from the master node needed to setup the worker nodes.
```
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
```
Copy it to your clipboard.
### Uninstalling Worker nodes
Run the command below to uninstall k3s on the master node.
```
/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```

## {meta.headers[3]}

Repeat the below process on each worker node.
Setting up enviromental variables.
"masternodeToken" is the token copied from the master node.
"UrlToMasterNode" is the address to the master node. in my case 192.168.0.100.
```
export K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE=”644"
export K3S_URL=”https://AddressToMasterNode:6443"
export K3S_TOKEN="masternodeToken"
```
Install k3s 
```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```
### Uninstalling Worker nodes
Run the command below to uninstall k3s on a worker node.
```
/usr/local/bin/k3s-agent-uninstall.sh
```

## Connectiong Kubectl to the cluster



## Wrapping up

You should now have a cluster, check out that everything worked out with 
```
kubectl get nodes
```

export default ({ children, categories }) => (
  <ArticleLayout meta={meta} categories={categories}>
    {children}
  </ArticleLayout>
);
